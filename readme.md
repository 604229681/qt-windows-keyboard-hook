Might as well make a readme

Qt application that creates a 'low level' windows keyboard hook. All keyboard keys are recognizable and get sent right back to the main Qt program.

I did this mainly because I wanted multimedia keys but my keyboard doesn't have any (and isn't programmable! but it's still a lovely keyboard). 

So to overcome this, in linux it's stupid easy to make keyboard combinations to modify your system. I used Super (Windows) + F9 and Super+F10 key combinations to play/pause and 'goto next track'

Couldn't do this in Windows, and didn't want to run autohotkey script. So I decided to make a quick, super lightweight program to do it for me and voila, works like a charm.

When the program runs, it's invisible and takes up a whole 1.7 mb. The ultimate full keyboard macro controller thing ever.

Not bad for a 10 minute job.
